How to use
----------

Run "npm install" inside this project folder to install all dependencies.

Make sure you use the latest version of the CLI (upgrade guide below)

Run "ng serve" to see the app in action (try "npm start" in case "ng serve" fails).

Feel free to compare it with your project code to spot any errors you might have.

## Running App Locally
Prerequisites:
- Make sure to have npm installed.
- Run "npm install -g @angular/cli" without quotations to install Angular CLI globally on your machine.
    
 If this is your first time:
 - Download master source folder from GitHub.
 
Otherwise just pull current "/src" folder from GitHub (unless new dependencies have been added to the source)

1.  Once you have the current copy of the repository, open your command prompt and navigate to the folders location on your desktop.
2.  Type in the command "ng serve -o" and this will open a local webpage with our app.
    (Any edit you make will be updated with simply saving, unless command prompt is closed or process is stopped.)
    (To Exit the process, press Ctrl + C then type Y and Enter on Windows)
3.  Once your done editing your files, and checks are made, commit and push to GitHub.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
